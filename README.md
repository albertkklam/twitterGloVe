# twitterGloVe
Exploring word vectors from Twitter using Python 2.7 and GloVe. GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. More information can be found [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)

* [explore.ipynb](explore.ipynb) is a notebook that imports the Twitter GloVe dataset, which contains 200 dimensional word vectors for 1.2m words. It includes sections that calculate the cosine similarity between any two word vectors, and looks into how well linear substructures are captured.
